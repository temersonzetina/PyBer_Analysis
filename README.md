# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide insights to executives of PyBer, a ride-sharing company, about the company's key results over the course of a 4-month span in 2019 by city type (urban, suburban, and rural). Equipped with the information provided herein, executives will be able to observe trends and disparities that can inform strategic priorities moving forward.

The steps involved in conducting this analysis are immediately below:

* Clean and merge the key data sources, which included a file with ride-level data and a file with information about each city's driver counts; The ride-level file captured information from January through April 2019
* Gather aggregate indicators by city type (Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares)
* Use these aggregate indicators to calculate Average Fare/Ride and Average Fare/Driver
* Visualize these data into a table
* Calculate and store fare totals by date and city type
* Visualize these totals in a line plot

## Results
The table below illustrates the differences in key results by city type. The sub-sections below describe these differences in greater detail.

### Total Rides
Rural towns had fewer rides (125) than suburban (625) and urban (1625) locales. Larger populations seem to predict more usage in terms of ride-sharing services.

### Total Drivers
The differences in total drivers by city type were far greater than differences in total rides, both in absolute terms and proportionatliy. The number of rural rides was one-fifth that of suburban rides, which were around 40% of urban rides. But the number of rural drivers was around one-sixth the number of suburban drivers, which were just 20% of the total number of urban drivers. The differences in total rides and total drivers represent important considerations for managing supply against demand (see summary below).

### Total Fares
The proportion of Total Fares in rural areas to Total Fares in suburban areas was similar (roughtly one-fifth) to the proportion of Total Drivers between these two city types. Suburban Total Fares were nearly half that of Total Fares in urban areas, which is well over double the proportion between these two in terms of Total Drivers.
